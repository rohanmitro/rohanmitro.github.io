Hello! I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Artificial Intellgence and Data Science, jointly offered by [Technische Hochschule Deggendorf](https://www.th-deg.de/) and [University of South Bohemia](https://www.jcu.cz/cz/). I am interested in software engieering, AI, and web technologies. I intend to use this page to share my work, projects, add more things as they evolve.

I have previously worked at [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/), one of the largest hedge funds as a Data Extraction Engineer. My role was to develop and maintain alternative data pipelines, a critical aspect of the firm's operations. Prior to this, I have worked at [LatentView Analytics](https://www.latentview.com/) as a Data Analyst, a prominent analytics consulting company based in India.

Outside of work, I find myself interested in reading, travelling and hiking.
